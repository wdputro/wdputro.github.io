      <description>I came home a little late that day. My son was playing by himself while my wife slept. “She must be tired since she has to run two experiments earlier that day,” I thought to myself. This semester she needs to finish her master thesis.
So I cooked the dinner, let my son eat first… and gently went to the bedroom to wake her up. She was half awake already… and I knew something upset her.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a blog post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/why-generation-y-yuppies-are-unhappy.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the ‘unhappy’ Generation Y&lt;/a&gt; that being viral in my Facebook timeline. Being part of that generation, I’d say it is relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising though that the author brings issue of parenting early in the articles. And the analysis is quite legit. Some might even think simply to blame the parents. After all, it was their fault right?&lt;/p&gt;
