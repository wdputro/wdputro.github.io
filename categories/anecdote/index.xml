      <description>Dad :  &amp;ldquo;Son, can you look who&amp;rsquo;s that?&amp;rdquo;   Son :  &amp;hellip;still cryng after his tantrum, he looked at the mirror. &amp;ldquo;He looks&amp;hellip; bad&amp;rdquo;   Dad :  &amp;ldquo;Well boy, that one there is angry!&amp;rdquo;    Knowing yourself is hard. Heck, it’s even harder for children. And as a parent, it is such a constant struggle. I hate myself when yelling to him.</description>

      <description>I came home a little late that day. My son was playing by himself while my wife slept. “She must be tired since she has to run two experiments earlier that day,” I thought to myself. This semester she needs to finish her master thesis.
So I cooked the dinner, let my son eat first… and gently went to the bedroom to wake her up. She was half awake already… and I knew something upset her.</description>
